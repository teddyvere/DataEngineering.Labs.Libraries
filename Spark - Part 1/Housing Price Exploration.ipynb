There is a wealth of information available online about Spark, as it is one of the most in demand data engineering tools today. In general, Spark is the de facto tool of choice for working with large data sets, streaming data, or high concurrency workloads.\n","\n","In this lab, you'll read in some datasets and do a few basic tasks. The beauty of Spark is that you can write it on a local machine, and then deploy it to a massive cluster and thus scale your workload seamlessly.\n","\n","For now you'll use Databricks to run the lab. Databricks is a company that provides a managed Spark solution. Although you can run Spark anywhere, using Databricks will allow us to jump right into learning the program, without needing to spend any time configuring the environment.\n","\n","You may notice that parts of Spark feels a bit like pandas or SQL. This is because much of Spark's feel has been inherited from those tools. In general Spark is just a little more verbose than pandas, but in return for that verbosity, you get incredible power.\n","\n","If you'd like to read up in great depth, this [e-book](https://runawayhorse001.github.io/LearningApacheSpark/pyspark.pdf) is excellent.\n","\n","We'll use a popular Kaggle dataset for this lab.
