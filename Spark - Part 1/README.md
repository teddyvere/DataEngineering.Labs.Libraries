The [arcos_all_washpost.tsv](https://d2ty8gaf6rmowa.cloudfront.net/dea-pain-pill-database/bulk/arcos_all_washpost.tsv.gz) file is not used in the lab, but is a really cool 80GB database of every opiod pill sold in the USA from 2006-2014. It's too large to use on Databricks community, but if you'd like to run Spark locally, or on a larger/paid Databricks account, this dataset would be an excellent place to start on a truly BIG data project.
